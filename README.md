## Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using Random Forest and XGBoost models. The dataset used is creditcard.csv, which contains transaction details. Advanced feature selection techniques like Boruta and RFECV are used to enhance model performance and reduce false positives. Additionally, an automated fraud monitoring pipeline is implemented.

## Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales data, and performs class balancing.

Feature Selection: Utilizes Boruta and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV).

Model Training: Implements Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.

Evaluation Metrics: Calculates accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Fraud Monitoring Pipeline: Allows real-time fraud detection on new transactions.
